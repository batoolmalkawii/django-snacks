In this project, we built out a small, but functional, multi page web site using Django.

We did it using the “Django Way” and noticed the dramatic performance gains we can get with a mature, robust framework.

1. We created a web site in Django with 2 pages:
    * home page
    * about page
2. Creates `views/urls/templates` as needed for home and about pages.
3. Used ancestor template to contain navigation elements.
